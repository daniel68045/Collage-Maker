## Music Recommendation Web App

Began with practicing/learning Python and some machine learning scripts, then created a small prototype of a music recommendation system using fake data.

Eventually, using Spotify's Web API to retrieve user data (top artists, genres, listening history), created a Flask web application to recommend 30+ new artists based on the userâ€™s Spotify data.

## How to Run

1. Clone into the repository with web URL:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/daniel68045/Music-Rec.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```
   python3 music_rec_system.py
   ```
