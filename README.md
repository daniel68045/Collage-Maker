Began with practicing/learning Python and some machine learning scripts, and then creating a small protoype of a music recomendation script using fake data.

Eventually, using Spotify's Web API to retrieve user data (top artists, genres, listening history), created a Flask web application to recommend a user 15-20 new artists based on their Spotify data.
