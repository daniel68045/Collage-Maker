## Music Recommendation Web App

Began with practicing/learning Python and some machine learning scripts, then created a small prototype of a music recommendation system using fake data.

Eventually, using Spotify's Web API to retrieve user data (top artists, genres, listening history), created a Flask web application to recommend 30+ new artists based on the userâ€™s Spotify data.
